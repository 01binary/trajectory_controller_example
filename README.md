# Integrating Hardware Controllers with MoveIt!

There are a few paths for integrating a controller that moves robot joints with the MoveIt! framework, which accommodate simple usage scenarios all the way to advanced customization:

* Stock controllers [JointTrajectoryController](http://wiki.ros.org/joint_trajectory_controller) and [GripperActionController](http://wiki.ros.org/gripper_action_controller) from [ROS controllers](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_controllers) package are supported out of the box because MoveIt implements integration interfaces and plugins that bridge them with MoveIt motion planning pipeline.
* Any other controllers managed by [ROS Controller Manager](http://wiki.ros.org/controller_manager) can be used by linking them with an existing MoveIt integration plugin, as long as they support [Follow Joint Trajectory Action](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/control_msgs/html/action/FollowJointTrajectory.html).
* Controllers that are managed by [ROS Controller Manager](http://wiki.ros.org/controller_manager) but don't support [Follow Joint Trajectory Action](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/control_msgs/html/action/FollowJointTrajectory.html) can be bridged with MoveIt by implementing MoveIt integration interfaces and exporting a plugin, as long as they can be made to fit into the [MoveIt Controller Handle](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/moveit_core/html/classmoveit__controller__manager_1_1MoveItControllerHandle.html) interface, and their input command can be translated from [moveit_msgs::RobotTrajectory](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/moveit_msgs/html/msg/RobotTrajectory.html) message.
* Custom controllers that are not managed by [ROS Controller Manager](http://wiki.ros.org/controller_manager), or for which the [MoveIt Controller Handle](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/moveit_core/html/classmoveit__controller__manager_1_1MoveItControllerHandle.html) is a poor fit, can be integrated by writing a custom MoveIt Controller Manager.

We will look at each of these options in more detail.

## Stock ROS Controllers

The [JointTrajectoryController](http://wiki.ros.org/joint_trajectory_controller) and [GripperActionController](http://wiki.ros.org/gripper_action_controller) from [ROS controllers](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_controllers) package are supported out of the box for simple usage scenarios, and can be easily configured by using the [MoveIt Setup Assistant](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html) (*MSA*) on the *Controllers* page.

These controllers are integrated with MoveIt by using existing [MoveIt Controller Handles](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/moveit_core/html/classmoveit__controller__manager_1_1MoveItControllerHandle.html):

* Stock [JointTrajectoryController](http://wiki.ros.org/joint_trajectory_controller) is integrated through [Joint Trajectory Controller Handle](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/noetic-devel/moveit_plugins/moveit_simple_controller_manager/include/moveit_simple_controller_manager/follow_joint_trajectory_controller_handle.h).
* Stock [GripperActionController](http://wiki.ros.org/gripper_action_controller) is integrated through [Gripper Controller Handle](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/noetic-devel/moveit_plugins/moveit_simple_controller_manager/include/moveit_simple_controller_manager/gripper_controller_handle.h).

The [ROS Controller Manager](http://wiki.ros.org/controller_manager) recognizes and loads these controllers from `ros_controllers.yaml` configuration file generated by MSA because they are [exported as plugins](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/blob/noetic-devel/joint_trajectory_controller/ros_control_plugins.xml) by the [ROS Controllers](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_controllers) package using their `type` names:

```
arm_controller:
  type: velocity_controllers/JointTrajectoryController
  joints:
    - shoulder_joint
    - upperarm_joint
    - forearm_joint
  gains:
    shoulder_joint:
      p: 100
      d: 1
      i: 1
      i_clamp: 1
    upperarm_joint:
      p: 100
      d: 1
      i: 1
      i_clamp: 1
    forearm_joint:
      p: 100
      d: 1
      i: 1
      i_clamp: 1
gripper_controller:
  type: position_controllers/GripperActionController
  joint: gripper
```

The *MoveIt Simple Controller Manager* configured by MSA [as the default](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_setup_assistant/templates/moveit_config_pkg_template/launch/move_group.launch#L17) will load the *handles* that bridge these controllers with MoveIt by reading the `simple_moveit_controllers.yaml` configuration file, for example:

```
controller_list:
  - name: arm_controller
    action_ns: follow_joint_trajectory
    type: FollowJointTrajectory
    default: True
    joints:
      - shoulder_joint
      - upperarm_joint
      - forearm_joint
  - name: gripper_controller
    action_ns: gripper_cmd
    type: GripperCommand
    default: True
    joints:
      - gripper
```

The mapping from ROS controller `name` to MoveIt *controller handle* `type` is done by using pre-defined *simple integration types*:

* `FollowJointTrajectory`: specifying this integration type will bridge the ROS controller specified by the `name` setting to the MoveIt pipeline through the [Joint Trajectory Controller Handle](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/noetic-devel/moveit_plugins/moveit_simple_controller_manager/include/moveit_simple_controller_manager/follow_joint_trajectory_controller_handle.h).
* `GripperCommand`: specifying this integration type will bridge the ROS controller specified by the `name` setting to the MoveIt pipeline through the [Gripper Controller Handle](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/noetic-devel/moveit_plugins/moveit_simple_controller_manager/include/moveit_simple_controller_manager/gripper_controller_handle.h).

In both cases, `action_ns` specifies the Action Server name exposed by the ROS controller. The full topic name consists of the ROS controller `name` and the `action_ns`. If you were to list topics by using `rostopic list` with the above two ROS controllers loaded, you would see something like the following:

```
/arm_controller/command
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/cancel
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/feedback
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/goal
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/result
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/status
/arm_controller/gains/forearm_joint/parameter_descriptions
/arm_controller/gains/forearm_joint/parameter_updates
/arm_controller/gains/shoulder_joint/parameter_descriptions
/arm_controller/gains/shoulder_joint/parameter_updates
/arm_controller/gains/upperarm_joint/parameter_descriptions
/arm_controller/gains/upperarm_joint/parameter_updates
/arm_controller/state
...
/gripper_controller/gripper_cmd/cancel
/gripper_controller/gripper_cmd/feedback
/gripper_controller/gripper_cmd/goal
/gripper_controller/gripper_cmd/result
/gripper_controller/gripper_cmd/status
...
```

To test simple controller integration with *MoveIt Simple Controller Manager*, launch the package generated by MSA by using the `move_group.launch` file. This will load your robot description and the MoveIt motion planning pipeline hosted in `move_group` node from `moveit_ros_move_group` package.

> This launch file assumes that your robot's [hardware interface](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control/Tutorials/Create%20your%20own%20hardware%20interface) is already running, since any ROS controllers you use will attempt to connect to this interface and send commands. It does not not include any [visualization](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/tutorials/quickstart_in_rviz/quickstart_in_rviz_tutorial.html) and does not [simulate the hardware interface](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_control&cat=connect_ros). In the absence of visualization and/or simulation tools, you can use the [C++](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/examples/moveit_cpp/moveitcpp_tutorial.html), [Python](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/examples/motion_planning_python_api/motion_planning_python_api_tutorial.html), or [Command Line](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/moveit_commander_scripting/moveit_commander_scripting_tutorial.html) interface to interact with MoveIt.

## ROS Controllers with Joint Trajectory Action

The *MoveIt ROS Control Controller Manager* which is the default configured by MSA for visualizing and/or simulating the robot does not use the configuration in `simple_moveit_controllers.yaml` to discover controllers. Instead it queries [ROS Controller Manager](http://wiki.ros.org/controller_manager) for loaded and active controllers.

Since this discovery process does not use the pre-defined types `FollowJointTrajectory` and `GripperCommand` (only supported by *Simple Controller Manager*), [Controller Handle Allocator](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_plugins/moveit_ros_control_interface/include/moveit_ros_control_interface/ControllerHandle.h) plugins also need to be exported for each controller used in this fashion to link ROS controllers to MoveIt *Controller Handles* by their type names.

While [JointTrajectoryController](http://wiki.ros.org/joint_trajectory_controller) from [ROS controllers](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_controllers) is supported by *MoveIt ROS Control Controller Manager* out of the box because its [Controller Handle Allocator](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_plugins/moveit_ros_control_interface/src/joint_trajectory_controller_plugin.cpp) is [exported](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_plugins/moveit_ros_control_interface/moveit_ros_control_interface_plugins.xml) as a plugin, the [GripperActionController](http://wiki.ros.org/gripper_action_controller) is not. Even though it has a [Controller Handle](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_plugins/moveit_simple_controller_manager/include/moveit_simple_controller_manager/gripper_controller_handle.h), it does not implement or export the corresponding *Controller Handle Allocator* plugin that enables the controller handle to be dynamically created from ROS controller type name. The next few sections will explain how to implement and export such a plugin.

> In the specific case of *Gripper Action Controller*, the corresponding allocator is not exported because this controller is only used in simple scenarios with *MoveIt Simple Controller Manager* - advanced users implement their own or use the Joint Trajectory Controller.

Stock *controller handles* implemented by MoveIt bridge ROS Controllers with the MoveIt motion planning pipeline by means of an [Action Client](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib), as long as the controller starts an *Action Server* that handles one of the two types of supported action interfaces:

* The [Joint Trajectory Controller Handle](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/noetic-devel/moveit_plugins/moveit_simple_controller_manager/include/moveit_simple_controller_manager/follow_joint_trajectory_controller_handle.h) plugin can be used for controllers that support [Follow Joint Trajectory Action](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/control_msgs/html/action/FollowJointTrajectory.html).
* The [Gripper Controller Handle](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/noetic-devel/moveit_plugins/moveit_simple_controller_manager/include/moveit_simple_controller_manager/gripper_controller_handle.h) plugin can be used for controllers that support [Gripper Command Action](https://docs.ros.org/en/jade/api/control_msgs/html/action/GripperCommand.html).

The *MoveIt ROS Control Controller Manager* will regard any controllers loaded by ROS Controller Manager as *managed* if it finds a plugin registration that links the `type` of the ROS controller with a MoveIt Controller Handle Allocator. If no such registration is found, the controller is regarded as *unmanaged* (merely *active*) and cannot be used to receive trajectory commands from MoveIt.

For example, see the stock Joint Trajectory Controller [plugin registration](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/noetic-devel/moveit_plugins/moveit_ros_control_interface/moveit_ros_control_interface_plugins.xml), which links several variations of this controller exported from `ros_controllers` package with the corresponding MoveIt Controller Handle that supports [Follow Joint Trajectory Action](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/control_msgs/html/action/FollowJointTrajectory.html) via an exported MoveIt *Controller Handle Allocator* plugin.

The same pattern can be followed to link any other ROS controller with a MoveIt *Controller Handle* so that it can receive trajectory commands.

First, create a plugin description file:

```
<library path="libmoveit_ros_control_interface_trajectory_plugin">
  <class
    name="controller_package_name/controller_type_name"
    type="moveit_ros_control_interface::JointTrajectoryControllerAllocator"
    base_class_type="moveit_ros_control_interface::ControllerHandleAllocator"
  >
    <description>
      Controller description
    </description>
  </class>
</library>
```

> Replace `controller_package_name/controller_type_name` and `Controller description` with values appropriate for your project.

Reference the plugin description in your package `export` section:

```
<export>
  <moveit_ros_control_interface plugin="${prefix}/controller_moveit_plugin.xml"/>
</export>
```

> Replace `/controller_moveit_plugin.xml` with a relative path of the plugin description file created in the previous step.

After building the package, any controllers in `ros_controllers.yaml` that reference `controller_package_name/controller_type_name` will become available for use with MoveIt.

The *MoveIt ROS Control Controller Manager* can be configured by changing the `moveit_controller_manager` setting to `ros_control`. The MoveIt configuration package auto-generated by MSA includes the [demo_gazebo.launch](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_setup_assistant/templates/moveit_config_pkg_template/launch/demo_gazebo.launch#L19) file that already configures this manager type in addition to launching [Gazebo](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_control&cat=connect_ros) simulation and visualizing the robot state in [RViz](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/tutorials/quickstart_in_rviz/quickstart_in_rviz_tutorial.html).

To test ROS controller integration with *MoveIt ROS Control Controller Manager*, launch the package generated by MSA by using the `demo_gazebo.launch` file. This will load your robot description, start the motion planning pipeline hosted in `move_group` node, and enable you to use the [Motion Planning Plugin](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/quickstart_in_rviz/quickstart_in_rviz_tutorial.html) in RViz to send goals to MoveIt, simulating the effect your ROS controllers will have on the real robot in Gazebo.

> Since the `GripperActionController` is not supported by MoveIt ROS Control Controller Manager, it can be replaced in the above example by `position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController`:
>```
> gripper_controller:
>  type: position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController
>  joints:
>    - gripper
>```

## ROS Controllers with another interface

What if you need to use a ROS controller that does not support [Follow Joint Trajectory Action](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/control_msgs/html/action/FollowJointTrajectory.html)? Some examples from [ROS controllers](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_controllers) package include:

* [Gripper Action Controller](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/blob/noetic-devel/gripper_action_controller/ros_control_plugins.xml) discussed earlier
* [Joint Position and Joint Group Position](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/blob/noetic-devel/position_controllers/position_controllers_plugins.xml) Controllers
* [Joint Position, Joint Velocity, and Joint Group Velocity](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/blob/noetic-devel/velocity_controllers/velocity_controllers_plugins.xml) Controllers
* [Joint Position, Joint Velocity, Joint Effort, Joint Group Effort, and Joint Group Position](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers/blob/noetic-devel/effort_controllers/effort_controllers_plugins.xml) Controllers

In this case, a *Controller Handle* and a *Controller Handle Allocator* may both need to be implemented. The allocator will also need to be exported by your package as a plugin.

The following package dependencies are required for implementing controller handles and allocators:

* `moveit_ros_control_interface` - Provides base classes for controller handles and allocators
* `pluginlib` - Provides macros for exporting a class as a plugin, only needed to export the controller handle allocator

The `actionlib` package may also be needed for communicating with the ROS controller via an Action Client if it exposes an Action Server.

The following headers declare the relevant classes and macros:

* `#include <moveit_ros_control_interface/ControllerHandle.h>`
  * declares `moveit_controller_manager::MoveItControllerHandle` class
  * declares `moveit_ros_control_interface::ControllerHandleAllocator` class
* `#include <pluginlib/class_list_macros.h>`
  * declares `PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS` macro for exporting plugins

Two example *controller handle* implementations are included with MoveIt:

* [follow_joint_trajectory_controller_handle.h](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_plugins/moveit_simple_controller_manager/include/moveit_simple_controller_manager/follow_joint_trajectory_controller_handle.h)
  * See implementation in [follow_joint_trajectory_controller_handle.cpp](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_plugins/moveit_simple_controller_manager/src/follow_joint_trajectory_controller_handle.cpp)
* [gripper_controller_handle.h](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_plugins/moveit_simple_controller_manager/include/moveit_simple_controller_manager/gripper_controller_handle.h)
  * Implemented inline in the same header file

As you can see, writing a [controller handle](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_core/controller_manager/include/moveit/controller_manager/controller_manager.h#L104) comes down to:
* Implementing a `sendTrajectory` method that translates [moveit_msgs::RobotTrajectory](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/moveit_msgs/html/msg/RobotTrajectory.html) to a format the controller can understand
* Implementing a `cancelExecution` method to tell the controller to stop any active trajectories
* Implementing a `waitForExecution` method that will block the calling thread until the controller finishes or the `timeout` is reached
* Implementing a `getLastExecutionStatus` method that returns the status of the last requested trajectory.

One example *controller handle allocator* plugin implementation is included with MoveIt:

* [joint_trajectory_controller_plugin.cpp](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_plugins/moveit_ros_control_interface/src/joint_trajectory_controller_plugin.cpp)

Since controller handle allocators are rather small, let's start by writing one for the Gripper Action Controller:

```
TODO
```

Create a plugin definition file and export the allocator as a plugin in `package.xml`:

```
TODO
```

Build your package, configure Gripper Action Controller as one of your controllers in `ros_controllers.yaml` and launch the MoveIt 

## Custom Controllers

Custom controllers not based on ROS Control can be integrated by writing and exporting a custom MoveIt *Controller Handle* plugin that conforms to the MoveIt interface and can be loaded by MoveIt Simple or ROS Controller Manager. If that interface is a poor fit for your custom controller, a custom MoveIt Controller Manager can be written that will take care of loading or unloading the controller, and managing its state and lifecycle.

## Fake Controllers
